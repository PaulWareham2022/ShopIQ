,"Funny part is actually cheaper to buy this bundle per millilitre if I’m only looking for the number two reagent and then throw away the other two items https://a.co/d/5PZ0BZC. But the shelf life will change that analysis. So it would be useful to look up the typical shelf life, but you need to be able to update that when you actually get the product to look at the best before data is printed on it. So we need some way to predict our forecast how much of this item we will actually use in the future. “How long do you think this amount will last you” — then it will remember that in the future.",,,,,,,,

,"$46.86 for all three bottles. If I throw away the ph, I have 22ml of each dpd for a blended price is $1.06 per ml blended. Vs 48.36 for individual purchase. So virtual the same price but I get the phenol red for “free”.",,,,,,,,

,I purchased my R0002 in January 2025 and it is now the end of August and it’s almost to the end. So it seems like I use about 34ml per year. Shelf life is a year So if I buy 60ml it should last me 1.77 years but I will have wastage after expiry. I will waste 43% of the bottle which would be worth $25.  It’s actually a complex set of calculations.,,,,,,,,
