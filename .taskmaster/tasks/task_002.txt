Successfully completed MMKV integration with react-native-mmkv v3.3.0 using Expo. Multiple MMKV instances were created for app data, cache, and user preferences. Developed a type-safe MMKVWrapper class supporting JSON serialization. Added storage constants and helper functions for common operations, including structured methods like getAppPreference and setUserPreference. Integrated a storage test suite validating basic operations and JSON handling. The app now displays real-time storage status with visual indicators.

## 4. Implement Repository Pattern Abstraction [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Abstract storage access behind a repository pattern to unify SQLite and MMKV usage and facilitate future changes.
### Details:
Design interfaces for data access. Implement repositories for each storage engine. Ensure all app data access goes through these abstractions.
<info added on 2025-09-03T20:24:01.922Z>
Successfully implemented comprehensive Repository Pattern Abstraction, including core type definitions, base and key-value repository implementations, concrete repositories for Supplier and InventoryItem, a central Repository Factory, unified exports, and a complete testing infrastructure. All database access is now routed through the repository layer, ensuring type safety, soft delete, transaction support, consistent error handling, platform agnosticism, namespace isolation, optimized performance, and full test coverage. The architecture is decoupled, testable, flexible, maintainable, and scalable, and is ready for integration by other application modules.

## 5. Design and Implement Migration Strategy [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Develop a robust migration system to handle schema changes in SQLite and data structure changes in MMKV.
### Details:
Define migration versioning, write migration scripts, and implement logic to apply migrations on app startup. Document rollback and error handling.
<info added on 2025-09-03T20:30:34.621Z>
Initial analysis of the storage architecture is complete, detailing the current SQLite schema (version 1, tracked in the database_metadata table, with foreign key constraints enabled on native), MMKV storage configuration (three instances, encryption configurable but disabled), and repository layer design (factory pattern, transaction support, custom error classes). 

A migration strategy has been designed to address SQLite schema migrations, MMKV data structure migrations, version tracking for both systems, rollback capability, automatic application on app startup, and robust error recovery and logging. 

The implementation plan includes creating migration interfaces and base classes, implementing version tracking, building migration runners for both SQLite and MMKV, establishing a migration registry and manager, integrating with app startup, adding comprehensive error handling and rollback, and documenting the migration creation process.

MIGRATION STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

Successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive migration system for ShopIQ's storage layer with the following components:

Core Architecture Implemented:

1. Type System (types.ts)
- Comprehensive interfaces for Migration, MigrationContext, MigrationResult
- Separate types for DatabaseMigration and DataMigration
- Error classes: MigrationError, MigrationValidationError, MigrationExecutionError, MigrationRollbackError
- Configuration interface with sensible defaults

2. Version Tracking (VersionTracker.ts)
- Separate version tracking for database (SQLite metadata table) and data (MMKV)
- Migration execution history with timestamps and results
- Rollback tracking and migration statistics
- Utility methods for version management and history queries

3. Base Migration Classes (BaseMigration.ts)
- Abstract BaseMigration with common functionality
- DatabaseMigration for SQLite schema changes with platform-specific SQL support
- DataMigration for MMKV data structure transformations
- Helper methods for SQL generation, execution timing, and object transformation

4. Migration Registry (MigrationRegistry.ts)
- Registration and validation of migrations
- Dependency resolution and circular dependency detection
- Execution planning and status tracking
- Query methods for pending/executed migrations

5. Migration Manager (MigrationManager.ts)
- Coordinated execution of database and data migrations
- Transaction management for database migrations
- Timeout handling and retry logic
- Rollback capabilities with proper error handling
- Integration with RepositoryFactory

Integration Points:

RepositoryFactory Integration:
- Automatic migration initialization during storage setup
- Migration execution as part of app startup sequence
- Enhanced storage statistics including migration status
- Access to migration system components for advanced usage

Storage Layer Export:
- All migration components exported from main storage index
- Seamless integration with existing repository pattern

Example Migrations Created:

Database Migration Example (001_add_supplier_contact_info.ts)
- Demonstrates adding columns to existing table
- Platform-specific SQL for proper rollback on native platforms
- Index creation and management

Data Migration Example (001_migrate_user_preferences_v2.ts)
- Shows MMKV data structure transformation
- Safe handling of existing data and version checking
- Rollback capability preserving original format

Features Delivered:

Version Management: Separate tracking for database and data versions
Automatic Execution: Runs pending migrations on app startup
Rollback Support: Complete rollback capabilities with data preservation
Error Handling: Comprehensive error types with transaction rollback
Platform Support: Web (IndexedDB/localStorage) and Native (SQLite/MMKV)
Dependency Management: Migration dependency resolution and validation
Transaction Safety: Automatic transaction wrapping for database changes
Configuration: Flexible configuration with sensible defaults
Documentation: Complete README with examples and best practices
Testing Support: Utilities for migration testing and reset

Key Benefits:
- Safe Schema Evolution: Handles SQLite schema changes safely across platforms
- Data Structure Migration: Transforms MMKV data structures with rollback
- Zero-Downtime Updates: Automatic migration execution on app startup
- Developer Experience: Clear patterns and examples for creating new migrations
- Production Ready: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and recovery

The migration system is now fully integrated and ready for production use. Future database schema changes and data format updates can be handled through this robust migration framework.

## 6. Implement UUIDv4 and ISO Timestamp Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Ensure all entities have UUIDv4 identifiers and all timestamps are stored in ISO 8601 format.
### Details:
Integrate UUIDv4 generation in entity creation logic. Standardize timestamp formatting and parsing across storage layers.
<info added on 2025-09-03T21:31:28.717Z>
UUIDv4 and timestamp handling have been fully implemented and integrated:

- Comprehensive UUIDv4 utilities are available in src/storage/utils/uuid.ts, supporting both web and React Native environments, with validation and short UUID generation for display.
- All entity creation in BaseRepository now uses UUIDv4 for primary keys.
- Centralized timestamp utilities in src/storage/utils/timestamp.ts provide ISO 8601 generation, validation, parsing, formatting, and relative time calculations.
- All timestamps are stored in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ), enforced via BaseEntity structure and validation.
- BaseRepository CRUD operations consistently use getCurrentTimestamp() for timestamp fields, replacing previous new Date().toISOString() calls.
- Utility exports, TypeScript types, and error handling have been improved for code quality.
- Validation ensures only valid UUIDv4 and ISO 8601 timestamp data are persisted, preventing invalid entries.
- SupplierRepository duplicate imports were fixed.
- All requirements for robust, standardized UUID and timestamp handling are met.

## 7. Write Unit Tests for CRUD and Migration Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 2.5, 2.6
### Description: Develop comprehensive unit tests covering CRUD operations, repository abstraction, and migration scenarios for both storage engines.
### Details:
