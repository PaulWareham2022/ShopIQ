Version Tracking (VersionTracker.ts)\n- Separate version tracking for database (SQLite metadata table) and data (MMKV)\n- Migration execution history with timestamps and results\n- Rollback tracking and migration statistics\n- Utility methods for version management and history queries\n\n3. Base Migration Classes (BaseMigration.ts)\n- Abstract BaseMigration with common functionality\n- DatabaseMigration for SQLite schema changes with platform-specific SQL support\n- DataMigration for MMKV data structure transformations\n- Helper methods for SQL generation, execution timing, and object transformation\n\n4. Migration Registry (MigrationRegistry.ts)\n- Registration and validation of migrations\n- Dependency resolution and circular dependency detection\n- Execution planning and status tracking\n- Query methods for pending/executed migrations\n\n5. Migration Manager (MigrationManager.ts)\n- Coordinated execution of database and data migrations\n- Transaction management for database migrations\n- Timeout handling and retry logic\n- Rollback capabilities with proper error handling\n- Integration with RepositoryFactory\n\nIntegration Points:\n\nRepositoryFactory Integration:\n- Automatic migration initialization during storage setup\n- Migration execution as part of app startup sequence\n- Enhanced storage statistics including migration status\n- Access to migration system components for advanced usage\n\nStorage Layer Export:\n- All migration components exported from main storage index\n- Seamless integration with existing repository pattern\n\nExample Migrations Created:\n\nDatabase Migration Example (001_add_supplier_contact_info.ts)\n- Demonstrates adding columns to existing table\n- Platform-specific SQL for proper rollback on native platforms\n- Index creation and management\n\nData Migration Example (001_migrate_user_preferences_v2.ts)\n- Shows MMKV data structure transformation\n- Safe handling of existing data and version checking\n- Rollback capability preserving original format\n\nFeatures Delivered:\n\nVersion Management: Separate tracking for database and data versions\nAutomatic Execution: Runs pending migrations on app startup\nRollback Support: Complete rollback capabilities with data preservation\nError Handling: Comprehensive error types with transaction rollback\nPlatform Support: Web (IndexedDB/localStorage) and Native (SQLite/MMKV)\nDependency Management: Migration dependency resolution and validation\nTransaction Safety: Automatic transaction wrapping for database changes\nConfiguration: Flexible configuration with sensible defaults\nDocumentation: Complete README with examples and best practices\nTesting Support: Utilities for migration testing and reset\n\nKey Benefits:\n- Safe Schema Evolution: Handles SQLite schema changes safely across platforms\n- Data Structure Migration: Transforms MMKV data structures with rollback\n- Zero-Downtime Updates: Automatic migration execution on app startup\n- Developer Experience: Clear patterns and examples for creating new migrations\n- Production Ready: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and recovery\n\nThe migration system is now fully integrated and ready for production use.

Install the Maestro CLI and set up YAML-based test flows for end-to-end scenarios. Maestro offers a simpler setup process, improved Expo compatibility, built-in flakiness handling, and faster execution compared to Detox. No complex device configuration is required; instead, define test steps declaratively in YAML files and run them using the Maestro CLI. Integrate Maestro into the CI pipeline for automated E2E test execution.\n</info added on 2025-09-03T00:52:11.375Z>",
