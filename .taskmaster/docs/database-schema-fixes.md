# Database Schema Validation Fixes

## Issue: Missing Database Tables Error

### Problem
When implementing new database tables in ShopIQ, you may encounter "Missing database tables" errors during schema validation even though the SQL execution logs show the table creation is successful.

### Root Cause
The mock database implementation in `src/storage/sqlite/database.ts` has a hardcoded list of tables (around lines 84-92) that needs to be updated when new tables are added. The validation fails because the mock database returns this hardcoded list instead of the actual created tables.

### Solution
Update the `mockTables` array in `src/storage/sqlite/database.ts` to include the new table name:

```typescript
const mockTables = [
  'suppliers',
  'inventory_items', 
  'offers',
  'unit_conversions',
  'bundles',
  'historical_prices',  // âœ… Add new table here
  'database_metadata',
];
```

### Example Fix Applied
- **Issue**: `historical_prices` table was being created successfully but validation failed
- **Cause**: Mock database had `bundle_items` instead of `historical_prices` in the hardcoded list
- **Fix**: Updated the hardcoded list to include `historical_prices`

### When to Apply This Fix
- When adding new database tables to the schema
- When seeing "Missing database tables" errors during initialization
- When SQL execution logs show successful table creation but validation still fails
- When working with the web/mock database implementation

### Files to Check
1. `src/storage/sqlite/schemas.ts` - Ensure new table is in `ALL_SCHEMAS` and `requiredTables`
2. `src/storage/sqlite/database.ts` - Update `mockTables` array (lines 84-92)

### Debugging Steps
1. Check console logs for "Schema executed successfully" messages
2. Look for "Found tables" vs "Required tables" comparison in logs
3. Verify the mock database table list matches the required tables list
4. Ensure new table is included in both schema creation and validation lists
