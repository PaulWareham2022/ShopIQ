# Task ID: 17
# Title: App Theming and UI Consistency
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Apply the established design system and theming to all non-form UI components and screens, ensuring accessibility, clarity, and comprehensive documentation.
# Details:
A comprehensive standardized design system and form component library have already been implemented (see `src/components/forms/` and `src/constants/colors.ts`). The iOS-style color system with semantic naming and Apple-style interaction patterns are in place, with consistent theming across supplier and inventory forms. Remaining work focuses on applying the standardized components and color system to all non-form screens and UI elements, updating any legacy or non-conforming components, and ensuring all new screens adhere to the established patterns. Additionally, create and maintain design system documentation for developer onboarding and future scalability. Conduct an accessibility audit to ensure all UI elements (including non-form components) meet WCAG compliance using the established patterns.

# Test Strategy:
UI snapshot tests for non-form screens and components. Accessibility audits using axe-core/react-native, focusing on non-form UI. Review and validate design system documentation for completeness and clarity.
