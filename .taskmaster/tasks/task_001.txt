# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Expo React Native Project
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the Expo React Native project scaffold for ShopIQ, targeting iOS first with Android optional, using the latest Expo SDK 53 and React Native 0.77 with New Architecture enabled by default. Ensure compliance with 2025 minimum OS requirements and App Store tooling.
# Details:
Use Expo SDK 53 (2025) with React Native 0.77, which enables the New Architecture by default for enhanced performance and future compatibility. Initialize the project with the TypeScript template using the latest create-expo-app and expo@^53.0.0. Configure project metadata and versioning. Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality. Ensure compatibility with the latest SQLite and MMKV modules for Expo SDK 53 and the New Architecture. Use `expo install --fix` and `expo-doctor` to ensure all packages are compatible with SDK 53 and the New Architecture. Minimum OS requirements: Android 7+ (API 35), iOS 15.1+. Xcode 16+ is required for iOS builds to meet App Store requirements. Use `expo-doctor` to validate both package and environment compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds and runs on iOS simulator and physical device (iOS 15.1+), and Android 7+ device/emulator. Run lint and type checks. Use `expo-doctor` to validate package, environment, and architecture compatibility. Test SQLite and MMKV integration under Expo SDK 53.
