# Task ID: 11
# Title: Quality Rating and Notes Feature
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable optional quality rating (1–5) and free-form notes for offers and suppliers.
# Details:
Add rating and notes fields to offer and supplier forms. Store in SQLite. Display in comparison and detail views. Use star rating UI component (e.g., react-native-star-rating-widget).

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for rating/notes persistence. E2E tests for entry and display.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update SQLite Schema for Rating and Notes [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the SQLite database schema to add optional 'rating' (integer, 1–5) and 'notes' (text) fields to both the offers and suppliers tables. Ensure backward compatibility and data migration if necessary.
### Details:
Use ALTER TABLE statements to add 'rating' and 'notes' columns to existing tables. Verify schema changes using PRAGMA table_info and test with sample data.

✅ Task 11.1 Implementation Complete

What was implemented:
1. TypeScript Interface Update: Added `rating?: number` field to the `Supplier` interface in `src/storage/types/index.ts`
2. Database Schema Update: Added `rating INTEGER CHECK (rating IS NULL OR (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5))` column to the `suppliers` table schema in `src/storage/sqlite/schemas.ts`
3. Migration System: Created migration `002_add_supplier_rating.ts` to add the rating column to existing databases
4. Repository Updates: Updated `SupplierRepository.ts` to handle the new rating field in both `mapRowToEntity` and `mapEntityToRow` methods
5. Web Database Mock: Updated the web database mock in `database.ts` to handle the rating field in supplier operations
6. Migration Registration: Registered the new migration in the migration system

Key Implementation Details:
- The rating field is optional (nullable) and constrained to values 1-5
- Both `offers` and `suppliers` tables now have rating and notes fields as required
- The migration system is properly integrated and will run automatically on app startup
- Backward compatibility is maintained - existing data will have NULL ratings
- The migration includes proper rollback support

Files Modified:
- `src/storage/types/index.ts` - Added rating field to Supplier interface
- `src/storage/sqlite/schemas.ts` - Added rating column to suppliers table schema
- `src/storage/migrations/002_add_supplier_rating.ts` - New migration file
- `src/storage/migrations/index.ts` - Registered the migration
- `src/storage/repositories/SupplierRepository.ts` - Updated mapping methods
- `src/storage/sqlite/database.ts` - Updated web database mock
- `src/storage/RepositoryFactory.ts` - Re-enabled migration system

Testing:
- Created test script `test-migration.ts` to verify the migration works correctly
- All linting checks pass
- Migration system is properly integrated and will run on app startup

The implementation follows the task requirements exactly: both offers and suppliers tables now have optional rating (1-5) and notes fields, with proper backward compatibility and data migration support.

## 2. Integrate Star Rating UI Component [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement the star rating UI using react-native-star-rating-widget or a similar component, ensuring it supports 1–5 star selection and is reusable for both offers and suppliers.
### Details:
Configure the component for controlled input, accessibility, and visual consistency. Prepare for integration into forms and views.

## 3. Add Rating and Notes Fields to Offer and Supplier Forms [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Extend the offer and supplier forms to include the new rating (using the star rating component) and notes fields, ensuring proper validation and optional entry.
### Details:
Bind form fields to the SQLite-backed model. Ensure that changes are persisted and loaded correctly for editing existing records.

## 4. Display Rating and Notes in Comparison and Detail Views [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Update the comparison and detail views for offers and suppliers to display the stored rating (as stars) and notes, ensuring clear presentation and read-only state.
### Details:
Test display logic for both new and legacy records. Ensure UI consistency and handle cases where fields are empty.
