Version Tracking (VersionTracker.ts)\n- Separate version tracking for database (SQLite metadata table) and data (MMKV)\n- Migration execution history with timestamps and results\n- Rollback tracking and migration statistics\n- Utility methods for version management and history queries\n\n3. Base Migration Classes (BaseMigration.ts)\n- Abstract BaseMigration with common functionality\n- DatabaseMigration for SQLite schema changes with platform-specific SQL support\n- DataMigration for MMKV data structure transformations\n- Helper methods for SQL generation, execution timing, and object transformation\n\n4. Migration Registry (MigrationRegistry.ts)\n- Registration and validation of migrations\n- Dependency resolution and circular dependency detection\n- Execution planning and status tracking\n- Query methods for pending/executed migrations\n\n5. Migration Manager (MigrationManager.ts)\n- Coordinated execution of database and data migrations\n- Transaction management for database migrations\n- Timeout handling and retry logic\n- Rollback capabilities with proper error handling\n- Integration with RepositoryFactory\n\nIntegration Points:\n\nRepositoryFactory Integration:\n- Automatic migration initialization during storage setup\n- Migration execution as part of app startup sequence\n- Enhanced storage statistics including migration status\n- Access to migration system components for advanced usage\n\nStorage Layer Export:\n- All migration components exported from main storage index\n- Seamless integration with existing repository pattern\n\nExample Migrations Created:\n\nDatabase Migration Example (001_add_supplier_contact_info.ts)\n- Demonstrates adding columns to existing table\n- Platform-specific SQL for proper rollback on native platforms\n- Index creation and management\n\nData Migration Example (001_migrate_user_preferences_v2.ts)\n- Shows MMKV data structure transformation\n- Safe handling of existing data and version checking\n- Rollback capability preserving original format\n\nFeatures Delivered:\n\nVersion Management: Separate tracking for database and data versions\nAutomatic Execution: Runs pending migrations on app startup\nRollback Support: Complete rollback capabilities with data preservation\nError Handling: Comprehensive error types with transaction rollback\nPlatform Support: Web (IndexedDB/localStorage) and Native (SQLite/MMKV)\nDependency Management: Migration dependency resolution and validation\nTransaction Safety: Automatic transaction wrapping for database changes\nConfiguration: Flexible configuration with sensible defaults\nDocumentation: Complete README with examples and best practices\nTesting Support: Utilities for migration testing and reset\n\nKey Benefits:\n- Safe Schema Evolution: Handles SQLite schema changes safely across platforms\n- Data Structure Migration: Transforms MMKV data structures with rollback\n- Zero-Downtime Updates: Automatic migration execution on app startup\n- Developer Experience: Clear patterns and examples for creating new migrations\n- Production Ready: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and recovery\n\nThe migration system is now fully integrated and ready for production use.

Introduced reusable Picker component for inventory and supplier selection, with integrated repository access, search, empty state, and error handling. Inventory picker displays item name and category; supplier picker shows name and country/region. Deleted items and suppliers are filtered out. Supplier name snapshot is captured on selection. Form supports both prop-based and auto-fetch data, with retry on fetch errors. All new components are unit tested for auto-fill, repository integration, picker behavior, validation, and submission, with no TypeScript errors. OfferForm now uses these new components for a seamless user experience.\n</info added on 2025-09-06T02:41:33.870Z>",
